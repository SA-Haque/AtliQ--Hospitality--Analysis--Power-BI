# Problem Statement

 **AtliQ Grands** owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. 
 Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing 
 its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands 
 wanted to incorporate ‚ÄúBusiness and Data Intelligence‚Äù to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.

 Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them with insights from their historical data.

- Create the metrics according to the metric list.
- Create a dashboard according to the mock-up provided by stakeholders.
- Create relevant insights that are not provided in the metric list/mock-up dashboard.
